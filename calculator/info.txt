Kilograms per Square Meter per Millimeter (Kg/m²/mm) = (Bag Weight in Kilograms / Coverage in Square Meters) / Thickness in Millimeters

In this formula:

Bag Weight in Kilograms is the weight of one bag of plaster (e.g., 25 kg).
Coverage in Square Meters is the area that one bag of plaster can cover (e.g., 3 m²).
Thickness in Millimeters is the desired thickness of the plaster layer (e.g., 1 mm).
By using this formula, you can calculate how many kilograms of plaster are needed to cover a certain area at a specific thickness.
